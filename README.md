# Maze-Pathfinding-with-SDL
A short project designed to generate complex mazes and solve them using a set of well-known algorithms. It utilizes recursive backtracking, Prim's algorithm, and Kruskal's algorithm to generate perfect mazes. A set of pathfinding techniques such as breadth-first search, A-star, dead-end filling, etc. are then used to find a path from the start to the end of the maze.
